# Introduction
GreenScore is created to encourage environmentally friendly behavior such as reducing the use of non-reusable materials, recycling, and increasing the level of use of eco-friendly materials. The website includes a vast range of features, such as hover flashcards, quizzes, real-time statistics, and many others which are tested to spread climate change awareness in an interactive and gamified way.
We learned specialized concepts of Web Development for the first time, in various languages including CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. We used different visually appealing ideas, including Parallax (visuals move in response to the scroll's movement).
# Inspiration
While everyone knows that climate change is a pressing issue, not many people have much to do about it. Many people know it's bad, but don't know how and why. This project aims to spread awareness of how climate change affects all of us and how people can take action by donating to leading organizations working to fight climate change
# What it does
On our homepage, we have live statistics about how climate change is affecting our planet. This will help speak to the hearts of the site visitors. We also have links to leading organizations that work to fight climate change in different ways. This will make it possible for the average person to be a part of the fight against climate change, without much effort, thus making them a Global Citizen. Our website also gives everyone a "GreenScore", which can be shared among friends. This can help create a social media trend where everyone shares their "GreenScore"s. This will incentivize more people to visit our website.
# How we built it
We built this using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap. We also used an API for the live stats.
# Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges with GIT and had to learn bits of JavaScript to help us create this project. The hover flashcards and live stats were not very easy to implement, as we had to use JavaScript and APIs.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the UI of our website, and how it is user-friendly.
# What we learned
We learned how to access APIs and use JavaScript to make the website interactive. We also learned how to collaborate on projects as a team and divide work well.
# What's next for GreenScore
We will work on making the GreenQuiz more fun and give it a better UI, as it has the potential to attract a lot of visitors to our website.
# Built With HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
